# SOC Toolkit

A modular toolkit for SOC (Security Operations Center) labs and demos.  
The goal is to simulate attacks, parse and monitor logs, and visualize results in dashboards.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `parsers/` â†’ log parsers (auth, firewall, web, etc.)
- `monitors/` â†’ real-time log monitors
- `demos/` â†’ attack simulations for SOC labs
- `engine/` â†’ core utilities (log formatting, export, etc.)
- `dashboards/` â†’ scripts for visualization
- `outputs/` â†’ exported logs and reports

## ðŸš€ Roadmap
- Log parsing and normalization
- Real-time monitoring with alerts
- Attack demos (bruteforce, port scan, etc.)
- Integration with ELK/Graylog
- Dashboards for visualization
